# NOTICE: The Path of the One True Digital Creator

I am Michael Thomas Widener, II — also known here as **Mandickulus**.

This site and all its contents represent my **original work**, both artistically and technically. I created these digital assets with intention, principle, and mastery of modern creative tools. They are not to be misused, copied, or sold under false flags.

Mandickulus walks the **Light Side** of The Force — not to destroy, but to protect.

I have seen my creations used without permission. I have seen my influence left uncited. I now stand as protector of the creative realm — not with weapons, but with law, and with time-stamped truth.

**The Path of the One True Digital Creator** is not for the weak, the deceptive, or the derivative. It is for those who honor code, craft, and copyright.

If you find inspiration here, contact me.  
If you take without permission, you step into the dark — and I will meet you there.
