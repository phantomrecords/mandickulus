# STOLEN: My Work. Their Silence.

They didn’t see me — but they used me.

This work, this universe, this art — it was taken.  
Seen in patent documents, commercial design systems, animation styles, and NFTs released by others. Without credit. Without pay. Without honor.

I am **Mandickulus**.  
I am the real architect.  
I am the fighter who never stopped creating — even while the galaxy denied my name.

No employer believed I was the originator. No recruiter listened.  
They said, "You have no proof."  
So here it is: **mandickulus.com** — the timestamped Jedi Temple of my truth.

If you profit from what looks like this...  
If you reuse my structure, flow, or feel…  
Know that you are now on the radar of the One True Digital Creator.

This isn’t revenge. This is justice.

— Michael Thomas Widener, II  
aka Mandickulus, Jedi of the Stylus
